# Custom Case App

I designed and developed a dynamic e-commerce platform for custom phone cases. Leveraging Next.js, I ensured seamless navigation and fast load times. Users can upload personalized images, which are dynamically displayed on their chosen phone case. Secure payments are handled via Stripe, and Prisma ORM ensures efficient data storage. This project highlights my full-stack development skills and UI/UX expertise.
